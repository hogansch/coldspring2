In addition, Cold Spring also has professional artists and musicians that provide instruction in visual arts, ceramic sculpture, and instrumental music, film, as well as drama. Cold Spring was designated a California Distinguished School in 1986 and recognized as a Blue Ribbon School in 1992 and in 2016 a Gold Ribbon School.

the Foundation:</h3><p>The Cold Spring School Foundation was established in 1980 in response to Serrano/Priest and Proposition 13 State Legislation. Combined with declining school enrollment, Cold Spring School was left with one of the lowest ADA&#x27;s (translate, &quot;funding status&quot;) in Santa Barbara County. In response to these monetary constraints, the Foundation was originally established to raise funding for art, music and library resources. Computer technology has become an additional beneficiary of this funding, as has Physical Education.</p><p>In addition to annual fund-raising events, the Foundation, as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt educational institution, also serves as the channel for various funds raised for specific endeavors such as the construction of the school library.</p><p>The Cold Spring School Foundation is charged with raising money to fund annual grant requests from the School Board. The Foundation supplements funding for staffing and instruction in the arts, music, drama, library and technology programs as a complement to the core subjects.</p><h3><b>Thank You from Superintendent/Principal:</b></h3><p>Dear Parents and Community Members,<br/></p><p>Cold Spring School continues to be ranked as a top 100 school in the State of California for its Academic Excellence in Education!\\\\u00a0 It\\\\u2019s our outstanding teachers and staff, parents and community partnerships who work together to provide an outstanding learning environment are what make Cold Spring School truly special!<br/></p><p>Cold Spring School has created a learning environment that encourages self-discovery with multiple hands-on learning opportunities.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 The committed teachers and staff are constantly striving to identify and support each child\\\\u2019s Passion by offering a comprehensive core program that incorporates Art, Physical Education, Music and Theatre, Technology and Design/Engineering.<br/></p><p>Together, we are working to ensure every student leaves sixth grade with a desire to \\\\u201cmake a difference in our world\\\\u201d by following his/her Passion.

Not only does this program provide an opportunity for our students to engage in real-world situations as context for learning, STEAM supports and reinforces our California content standards.</p><h3>Preparing for the Real-World</h3><p>Through the STEAM program, our students use Project-based Learning and the engineering design process to create everything from functioning models of human organs, to a symphony of well-tuned musical instruments. The curriculum is fluid and responsive to real-world events. Classroom teachers work closely with the STEAM specialist to generate a seamless flow of lessons that allow students to experience firsthand that the world is not comprised of discrete disciplines, but interdependent, ever-connected systems. Rather than memorizing facts in isolation, students construct a constantly evolving and expanding framework of knowledge - a lasting lens through which they view and make sense of the world around them.</p><h3>Preparing All Learners</h3><p>Through STEAM, Cold Spring students are on a journey of discovery, problem solving, failed first attempts, and triumphant solutions. This type of inquiry-driven learning engages students by transferring ownership from the teacher into the hands of the class. The unique strengths and gifts of each student are emphasized, and all learning styles have an opportunity to be successful. Students are scientists and engineers from their first moments at Cold Spring.</p><h3>Preparing Citizens</h3><p>In STEAM, our students are fixers. They are yes-sayers, and &quot;I don&#x27;t know but I can figure it out&quot; believers. They collaborate. They persevere. And fundamentally, they see STEAM as an opportunity for stewardship. They serve the community, and recognize their role in contributing positively to the world around them.</p><p>The STEAM Program in Cold Spring is engaging, hands-on and reality-based with many extensions to draw education and the community together for the common good of bettering our school. We believe that STEAM benefits all of our students, and we are very excited and proud of its success in the Cold Spring School District.<br/></p><p><a href=\\\\\\\"https://animoto.com/play/yeBYJFx5Ti8ko1GOw06uig\\\\\\\">Cold Spring School STEAM Showcase</a></p>\\\", \\\"bg_color\\\": \\\"white\\\"}, \\\"id\\\": \\\"e9d37516-d75b-44c1-8a69-b73d0aee319f\\\"}]\"}", "approved_go_live_at": null}}, {"model": "wagtailcore.pagerevision", "pk": 114, "fields": {"page": 53, "submitted_for_moderation": false, "created_at": "2020-01-14T23:07:53.649Z", "user": 1, "content_json": "{\"pk\": 53, \"path\": \"00010001000A\", \"depth\": 3, \"numchild\": 0, \"title\": \"Art\", \"draft_title\": \"Art\", \"slug\": \"art\", \"content_type\": 15, \"live\": true, \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"url_path\": \"/home/art/\", \"owner\": 1, \"seo_title\": \"\", \"show_in_menus\": false, \"search_description\": \"\", \"go_live_at\": null, \"expire_at\": null, \"expired\": false, \"locked\": false, \"first_published_at\": null, \"last_published_at\": null, \"latest_revision_created_at\": null, \"live_revision\": null, \"submenutitle\": \"Home\", \"content\": \"[{\\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\", \\\"value\\\": {\\\"richtext_content\\\": \\\"<p>At Cold Spring School our teachers work together to create units of study that incorporate fine art into the development of motor skills, cognitive development, math concepts, engineering, language arts, and of course creativity! Our students understand how art fits into every aspect of learning and how it plays a part in world cultures, history and their future careers. Most importantly, art builds confidence through self directed problem solving and allows students to express their unique ideas in a fun and encouraging setting. This supportive and enriching environment at CSS allows the students to explore a wide range of media and techniques such as ceramics, painting, drawing, printmaking, fiber arts, sculpture and collage. Our little artists create functional ceramic pottery, pull prints off of a press, paint landscapes in the style of Impressionists, carve sculptures like the Romans and experience their own street painting festival. The students experience field trips to museums and galleries, visits from resident artists, and a school wide art exhibit that showcases their achievements.

The students at Cold Spring School District continue to perform in the top tier on the CAASPP in both English Language Arts and Mathematics. The high summative test scores can be attributed to teachers using their formative assessment data to monitor and adjust their instruction daily. The superintendent/principal progress monitors with teachers, students and parents to ensure all students make substantial progress toward meeting their quarterly benchmark goals and strive to improve. Students are aware of their learning trajectory as teachers give all students a copy of their Renaissance Learning STAR Reading and STAR Math baseline and benchmark growth report. The entire school community is committed to having a systematic approach to teaching and learning, which continues to result in high student learning outcomes. A 2019-2020 Professional Learning plan was created to provide support to teachers\\\\u00a0around the following school wide priority goals:</p><ul><li>Improving School Culture and Climate</li><li>Improving our Practices</li><li>Implementing the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation State Standards</li></ul><p>The Professional Learning Plan is designed to address Mathematics, Science, Technology, English Language Arts, Social/Emotional Development and Assessments to support Transitional Kindergarten through Sixth grade students. The plan is committed to creating\\\\u00a0coherence and comprehensiveness throughout all classrooms district-wide by grade level through high functioning professional learning communities. These vital factors will contribute to a greater impact on increasing student achievement and sustainable substantial change among those who serve them. The comprehensive professional development plan is developed with input recorded in\\\\u00a0the February 2017 Stakeholder Input Report, as well as the Needs Assessment survey the\\\\u00a0Superintendent/Principal sent to teachers and staff in July 2017. The comprehensive professional development plan is aligned to the Cold Spring School District LCAP and is created with the pedagogy to encourage and support teachers in giving them the tools and strategies to inspire their students to think differently by inspiring creativity. The great teachers and staff within the Cold Spring School District are committed to\\\\u00a0learning, teaching, leading and learning again. They recognize these attributes are necessary in creating a culture of community that fosters individuality, creativity and possibility. Teachers and administration engage in weekly after school content specific learning communities around the focus goals for student learning for the TK-2, 3-6 grade level strands. These weekly meetings begin at 2:30pm and occur every Wednesday. </p><h3>California Dashboard</h3><p>The California Dashboard is an online tool designed to help communities across the state access important information about K-12 districts and schools. The Dashboard features easy-to-read reports on multiple measures of school success. The Dashboard is just one\\\\u00a0step in a series of major shifts in public education, changes that have raised the bar for student learning, transformed testing, and increased the focus on equity. </p><h3>LCAP</h3><p>The Local Control and Accountability Plan or LCAP is a critical part of California\\\\u2019s new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). It is a three-year, district-level plan that is updated annually. The plan describes the school district\\\\u2019s key goals for students as well as the specific actions (with expenditures) the district will take to achieve the goals and the means (metrics) used to measure progress. The LCAP addresses the needs of all students, including specific student groups, and all districts must specifically address English learners, foster youth, and low-income students. In addition, the LCAP must address the state of California&#x27;s eight priority areas that include student academic achievement, school climate, student access to a broad curriculum, and parent engagement.

I began my educational career as a Kindergarten instructional assistant at Santa Barbara Christian School. Then I taught Physical Education, Kindergarten, and First and Fifth grades at the Santa Barbara Community Academy for seven years. I love teaching children! My love for children and the desire to help create an atmosphere of excellence in education led me to school administration. I was the principal of the Santa Barbara Community Academy for three years and then served as principal of Adams Elementary School for eight years. While at Adams, I helped to change the school\\u2019s under-performing reputation by focusing on educating the whole child. We did this by enhancing our programs in art, music, technology, physical education, and STEAM. I also helped to create an authentic Montessori education option for some of our students within the school\\u2019s traditional structure.\\u00a0 I feel blessed to have left both the Santa Barbara Community Academy and Adams Elementary School as Title I Achieving and California Distinguished Schools.<br/><br/> I gained further administrative experience when I served as the Interim Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education for the Santa Barbara Unified School District. While in that position, I created a comprehensive professional learning plan for the District\\u2019s teachers that around implementing the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards. I also developed a five day Summer Institute for teachers and assisted in writing the District\\u2019s LCAP.<br/><br/>I am committed to life-long learning and firmly believe that we should never stop learning and growing. My own path has included a BA in Liberal Studies with a minor in Kinesiology from Westmont College and teaching and administrative credentials, as well as two education Master\\u2019s Degrees, from Azusa Pacific University and a doctorate in Education Leadership from Concordia University.<br/><br/>For the last twenty-one years, it has been my passion to serve the children and families in Santa Barbara in their pursuit of educational excellence.

These three elements are explored in the book Creating Innovators: the Making of Young People Who Will Change the World by Dr. Tony Wagner.

Not only does this program provide an opportunity for our students to engage in real-world situations as context for learning, STEAM supports and reinforces our California content standards.</p><h3>Preparing for the Real-World</h3><p>Through the STEAM program, our students use Project-based Learning and the engineering design process to create everything from functioning models of human organs, to a symphony of well-tuned musical instruments. The curriculum is fluid and responsive to real-world events. Classroom teachers work closely with the STEAM specialist to generate a seamless flow of lessons that allow students to experience firsthand that the world is not comprised of discrete disciplines, but interdependent, ever-connected systems. Rather than memorizing facts in isolation, students construct a constantly evolving and expanding framework of knowledge - a lasting lens through which they view and make sense of the world around them.</p><h3>Preparing All Learners</h3><p>Through STEAM, Cold Spring students are on a journey of discovery, problem solving, failed first attempts, and triumphant solutions. This type of inquiry-driven learning engages students by transferring ownership from the teacher into the hands of the class. The unique strengths and gifts of each student are emphasized, and all learning styles have an opportunity to be successful. Students are scientists and engineers from their first moments at Cold Spring.</p><h3>Preparing Citizens</h3><p>In STEAM, our students are fixers. They are yes-sayers, and &quot;I don&#x27;t know but I can figure it out&quot; believers. They collaborate. They persevere. And fundamentally, they see STEAM as an opportunity for stewardship. They serve the community, and recognize their role in contributing positively to the world around them.</p><p>The STEAM Program in Cold Spring is engaging, hands-on and reality-based with many extensions to draw education and the community together for the common good of bettering our school. We believe that STEAM benefits all of our students, and we are very excited and proud of its success in the Cold Spring School District.<br/></p><p><a href=\\\"https://animoto.com/play/yeBYJFx5Ti8ko1GOw06uig\\\">Cold Spring School STEAM Showcase</a></p>\", \"bg_color\": \"white\"}, \"id\": \"e9d37516-d75b-44c1-8a69-b73d0aee319f\"}]"}}, {"model": "stream.textandimagepage", "pk": 53, "fields": {"submenutitle": "Home", "content": "[{\"type\": \"text\", \"value\": {\"richtext_content\": \"<p>At Cold Spring School our teachers work together to create units of study that incorporate fine art into the development of motor skills, cognitive development, math concepts, engineering, language arts, and of course creativity!

The students at Cold Spring School District continue to perform in the top tier on the CAASPP in both English Language Arts and Mathematics. The high summative test scores can be attributed to teachers using their formative assessment data to monitor and adjust their instruction daily. The superintendent/principal progress monitors with teachers, students and parents to ensure all students make substantial progress toward meeting their quarterly benchmark goals and strive to improve. Students are aware of their learning trajectory as teachers give all students a copy of their Renaissance Learning STAR Reading and STAR Math baseline and benchmark growth report. The entire school community is committed to having a systematic approach to teaching and learning, which continues to result in high student learning outcomes. A 2019-2020 Professional Learning plan was created to provide support to teachers\\u00a0around the following school wide priority goals:</p><ul><li>Improving School Culture and Climate</li><li>Improving our Practices</li><li>Implementing the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation State Standards</li></ul><p>The Professional Learning Plan is designed to address Mathematics, Science, Technology, English Language Arts, Social/Emotional Development and Assessments to support Transitional Kindergarten through Sixth grade students. The plan is committed to creating\\u00a0coherence and comprehensiveness throughout all classrooms district-wide by grade level through high functioning professional learning communities. These vital factors will contribute to a greater impact on increasing student achievement and sustainable substantial change among those who serve them. The comprehensive professional development plan is developed with input recorded in\\u00a0the February 2017 Stakeholder Input Report, as well as the Needs Assessment survey the\\u00a0Superintendent/Principal sent to teachers and staff in July 2017. The comprehensive professional development plan is aligned to the Cold Spring School District LCAP and is created with the pedagogy to encourage and support teachers in giving them the tools and strategies to inspire their students to think differently by inspiring creativity. The great teachers and staff within the Cold Spring School District are committed to\\u00a0learning, teaching, leading and learning again. They recognize these attributes are necessary in creating a culture of community that fosters individuality, creativity and possibility. Teachers and administration engage in weekly after school content specific learning communities around the focus goals for student learning for the TK-2, 3-6 grade level strands. These weekly meetings begin at 2:30pm and occur every Wednesday. </p><h3>California Dashboard</h3><p>The California Dashboard is an online tool designed to help communities across the state access important information about K-12 districts and schools. The Dashboard features easy-to-read reports on multiple measures of school success. The Dashboard is just one\\u00a0step in a series of major shifts in public education, changes that have raised the bar for student learning, transformed testing, and increased the focus on equity. </p><h3>LCAP</h3><p>The Local Control and Accountability Plan or LCAP is a critical part of California\\u2019s new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). It is a three-year, district-level plan that is updated annually. The plan describes the school district\\u2019s key goals for students as well as the specific actions (with expenditures) the district will take to achieve the goals and the means (metrics) used to measure progress. The LCAP addresses the needs of all students, including specific student groups, and all districts must specifically address English learners, foster youth, and low-income students. In addition, the LCAP must address the state of California&#x27;s eight priority areas that include student academic achievement, school climate, student access to a broad curriculum, and parent engagement.
